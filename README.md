# AlteMatrix

The CLI version of the [AlteMatrix](https://github.com/AyomideA-S/AlteMatrix_python) program.

The program is still in the preview stage but for now, you can try compiling the application yourself by running the following commands:

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyomideA-S/AlteMatrix.git
cd AlteMatrix
```

## Build

```bash
gcc ip_analyzer\<program_name>.c -o <output_name>
```

or

```bash
clang -o <output_name> ip_analyzer\<program_name>.c
```

Issues, suggestions and feedback are welcomed.

**You are also free to contact me to collaborate.**
